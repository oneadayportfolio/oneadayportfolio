<!-- Thank you to @FollowAndrew on YouTube for the introductory videos on HTML/CSS webpages. -->
<!-- A lot of the initial layout was done by following some examples from his channel. -->
<!-- Please check out his works if you are new to HTML/CSS web design: https://www.youtube.com/@FollowAndrew -->

<!-- The remainder of the website elements were assembled through piecing together documentations, general advices on forums, and other snippets of knowledge. -->

<!-- All resultant artwork displayed was made by me. I strive to make as much of it from scratch as possible. However, here are some great resources for you, that have helped me: -->

<!-- Some backdrops in my Blender renders come from: https://polyhaven.com/hdris -->
<!-- Sometimes I forgo the use of backdrops, but sometimes I use the freely available HDRIs available on the above site. Please check them out! -->

<!-- The rest of the content (3D models, textures, lighting, simulation, etc.) is usually procedurally generated within blender itself, customized to my taste. -->
